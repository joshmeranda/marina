  # In some cases you will need to enforce blocked and allowed images to conform to organization policies, or minimize
  # CVEs. Specify those in the fields below. Both blocked and allowed are not mutually exclusive, but if used together
  # can create more complexity than what is typically requried. If an image matches both blocked and allowed it will be
  # blocked.We recommaned using one or the other.

  # If any of the fields are left empty, it will match any value. For example, the image matcher:
  # - registry: ""
  #   repository: "namespace/name"
